! mesh Reynolds number Re_mesh= v*dx/nu = (tau*g/nu)*dx = (0.014 * 2.45/.0000138)*dx = 2485 * dx.
! We don't need to resolve Re_mesh < 1, since these flows will not be well represented by our value of nu
! Re_mesh > 1 -> dx > 0.000402 in code units
!
! So, with our given viscosity, we cannot accurately capture fluid velocity features on scales smaller than
! 0.000402 m = 402 micrometers, a bit more than twice the particle diameter of 165 micrometers.
!
! This information is useful for choosing the number of grid points (in cparam.local) in conjunction with
! the box size found here.
